    <b> 1.Introduction in javascript</b><br>
     A.1: Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. <br><br>
    <b> 2.javascript work and execution context</b><br>
     A.2:For does who don't know, the browser doesn't natively understand the high-level JavaScript code that we write in our applications. It needs to be converted into a format that the browser and our computers can understand – machine code.

     While reading through HTML, if the browser encounters JavaScript code to run via a script tag or an attribute that contains JavaScript code like onClick, it sends it to its JavaScript engine.
     
     The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.<br><br>
     <b>3.javascript code is executed and call stack</b><br>
     A.3:When you execute a script, the JavaScript engine creates a Global Execution Context and pushes it on top of the call stack. Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a function execution context for the function, pushes it on top of the call stack, and starts executing the function.<br><br>
     <b>4.js engine</b><br>
     A.4:JavaScript is a multi-paradigm prototype-based language, which uses JavaScript Engine such as Chrome’s V8 engine Firefox SpiderMonkey engine and etc. They convert the high level code into machine-readable code which lets computer to perform some specific tasks.<br><br>
     <b>5.Declaration in javascript</b><br>
     A.6:<b>Declarations:</b><br>
     <b>var</b>
     Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.<br>
     
    <b> let</b>
     Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.<br>
     
     <b>const</b>
     Declares a read-only named constant.<br><br>
     <b>6.hoisting in javascript</b><br>
     A.6:Function and variable declarations are hoisted in JavaScript. This means that they are stored in memory of the current Execution Context's VO and made available within the Execution Context even before the execution of the code begins.<br><br>
    <b> 7.undefined vs not defined</b><br>
     A.7:In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them. If the variable name which is being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it would be not defined, and if exists in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any value till now, then it would be undefined.<br><br>
     <b>8.DataTypes</b><br>
     A.8:javaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types: numbers, strings of text (known as “strings”), and boolean truth values (known as “booleans”). JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value.<br>
